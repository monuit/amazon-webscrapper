# Design Decisions
1. scraper.py, In method [get_page_content](https://github.com/ankushduacodes/amazon-search-scraper/blob/master/amazon_scraper_module/scraper.py#L102), retries were added to make a valid connection with amazon servers even if it connection request was denied.

2. function -> [get_request](https://github.com/ankushduacodes/amazon-search-scraper/blob/master/amazon_scraper_module/scraper.py#L56), returns None when requests.exceptions.ConnectionError occurs and ripples its way down to calling functions to terminate the thread normally instead of abruptly calling sys.exit() which surely will kill the thread but if the thread being killed holds GIL component, in that case it will lead to [Deadlock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadlock).

3. function -> [get_page_content](https://github.com/ankushduacodes/amazon-search-scraper/blob/master/amazon_scraper_module/scraper.py#L102), if no valid page was found even after retries it returns None in addition to returning None for Nonetype response from get_request.

4. Decision number 2 and 3 were made keeping in mind that in a multithreaded program, multiple threads are working simultaneously, while doing that there may be a case where 1 or 2 out of 10 or 20 threads does not get valid response (Please check [check_page_validity](https://github.com/ankushduacodes/amazon-search-scraper/blob/master/amazon_scraper_module/scraper.py#L83[) and [get_request](https://github.com/ankushduacodes/amazon-search-scraper/blob/master/amazon_scraper_module/scraper.py#L56) function for documentation and more), then we terminate only those threads safely while others work to produce the valid output.

# Performance Benchmark
On my network connection (results may vary depending on your connection speed)

Number of pages     | Number of products | Time              |
--------------------|--------------------|-------------------|
 1                  | 22                 | 2.657             |
 3                  | 126                | 4.007 sec         |
 7                  | 390                | 8.094 sec         |
 20                 | 426                | 12.534 sec        |
